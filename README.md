# Assignment 3 in Algorithms and datastructures

For problem 2, the folder Vehicles is for the different type of vehicles.

For problem 5, the cut off-depth, array size and iterations can be changed in Problem 5 class. To change swap method between heap/insert, 
comment out accordingly in Quicksort.java, in the private quicksort() method.

To run the code, make sure the files are in the same folder and run them through your IDE. Also make sure to open the entire folder in the IDE to access the other classes (can be done using the command "code ." in git bash, while located in this folder). I have been using VSCode for the development.

Problem1 class is for checking the MyHash functionality.

In Problem2 we random input data and analyse the hash function.

Problem3 and Problem4 are just for testing insert- and heap sort.

Problem5 is where we use the quicksort, where we swap to insert- or heap sort and compare them. The printout array is time taken for different cut off-depths.
